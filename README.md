## Hosting 
==
self-hosting rquires you to create a file named `secret.json`
with the following structure 
```
{
    "Token": "<token>",
    "DATABASE_URL": "<URL>"
}
```

Apart from this you will need to install all dependencies.

For heroku you need to add the buildpacks for opus and ffmpeg and set config variables
